# Decision

I assume the Task 1 customer is low priority as the date of going live is not yet decided so as it is not in the near future and as urgent as Task 2(that has its deployment in the near 2 days)

So, I would ask an extension for the Task 2 as logically I would be back to work on the release date
which equalizes my days off and the release date to be the ending same day

```
eg.
todays date 10th feb
tomorrows date 11th feb

I am off till 14th feb(3 day leave)
The client wants to go live on 12th feb

I request the extension for the date 15th feb which is the day of my returning work
```

**my day offs should not effect the Task 1 significantly as the date to launch is still not decided so an extension is not really needed**

# how I will explain the Account managers

I would simply explain the reason for my leave, as it is not a high priority project I am sure they will understand my situation and we can come up with a plan of how we can get back on track and also how can the tasks be distributed between the team to keep progress.

```email
Hi, @account manager

A family emergency has just come up due to which I will not be in office for the next 3 days I hope you understand the direness of my situation.

Before leaving I would like to handle all my tasks
This is the updates on my current tasks
--- updates on current tasks
These are the blockers my tasks may create
--- list of tasks that my absence creates a blocker on
I will still be available on calls/messages from 1500-2100 hours if I am needed further for any queries/issues
I have also requested a delay/extension for the release of Task 2 from the client
Thank you for you considerations
- A diligent worker
```

# Explanation to the client

```email
hi @client,

You may be aware that we have a go-live task coming up in the next few days, I assume you are as excited as we are and also a bit nervous about the outcome.
So, to ensure everything goes without a hitch we wanted to request a extension of 3 days in which we can properly and rigorously test the features and working of the product we also want to try an do some demo launches to try and check everything properly so that we don't have an issue on the big day.
Thank you for your understanding and support.
Lets build greatness.
```
