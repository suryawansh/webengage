hey, I tried my best to stick to the assignments given but given the time constraint I had to try and get things done quicker by using libraries to aid my development

A hearty thank you for giving me this opportunity and regardless of the outcome I would like to say those were some fun problems which I thoroughly enjoyed solving

here are my answers to the problems

- [Task 1](https://suryawansh.github.io/webengage/Task1/)
- [Task 2](https://suryawansh.github.io/webengage/Task2/)
- [Task 3](https://suryawansh.github.io/webengage/Task3/)
